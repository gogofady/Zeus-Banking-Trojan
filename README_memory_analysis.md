# Memory Analysis for Detecting Zeus Banking Trojan

This document outlines the process of analyzing memory to identify and confirm the presence of the Zeus Banking Trojan using Volatility.

---

## Determining the Profile
To begin, determine the memory image profile with the `imageinfo` plugin:
```bash
python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem imageinfo
```
The analysis identified the system as running Windows XP. From the recommended profiles, we selected "WinXPSP2x86."

---

## Examining Processes
1. **List Processes**: Use the `psscan` plugin to list processes:
   ```bash
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 psscan
   ```
   Observations: Process counts and names appeared normal.

2. **Analyze Process Tree**: Use the `pstree` plugin to examine parent-child relationships:
   ```bash
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 pstree
   ```
   Observations: No irregularities were detected in the relationships.

---

## Investigating Network Connections
Network activity was analyzed for signs of suspicious behavior:
```bash
python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 connections
python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 connscan
```
Results: Suspicious IP addresses were identified, warranting further investigation via VirusTotal.

## Analyzing the Malicious Process
1. **Filter Process by PID**:
   ```bash
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 psscan | grep 1752
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 pstree | grep 1752
   ```
2. **Check Process Path**:
   ```bash
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 cmdline | grep 1752
   ```
   Observations: Process path appeared legitimate.

---

## Investigating Code Injection
To identify malicious code injection:
```bash
python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 malfind -p 1752
```
Results: The process exhibited an MZ header and the `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` memory protection, indicating executable and writable memory regionsâ€”a hallmark of code injection.

---

## Dumping Malicious Artifacts
1. **Dump Process**:
   ```bash
   mkdir procdump
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 procdump -p 1752 -D procdump/
   ```
   Check the hash of the dumped executable:
   ```bash
   sha256sum procdump/executable.1752.exe
   ```

2. **Dump Injected Memory Region**:
   ```bash
   mkdir vaddump
   python2 vol.py -f zeus2x4.vmem --profile WinXPSP2x86 vaddump -p 1752 -b 0x3080000 -D vaddump/
   sha256sum vaddump/
   ```
Results: The memory dump confirmed malicious activity.

---

## Findings
1. **Active and Injected Processes**: The process with PID 1752 exhibited suspicious behavior and memory injection consistent with Zeus malware.
2. **Network Connections**: Connections to external IPs linked to command-and-control (C2) servers, with encrypted communication traces.
3. **Malware Artifacts**: Dumped executable and memory regions aligned with known Zeus signatures, confirmed via hash analysis.

This analysis demonstrates the presence of Zeus Banking Trojan through memory analysis, process investigation, and artifact dumping for further correlation with known malware databases.
